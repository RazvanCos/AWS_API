# Serverless Framework Node REST API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to make a simple REST API with Node.js running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the traditional Serverless Framework.

This template does not include any kind of persistence (database). For a more advanced examples check out the [examples repo](https://github.com/serverless/examples/) which includes Typescript, Mongo, DynamoDB and other examples.

## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard which includes advanced features like CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

```
$ serverless login
$ serverless deploy
```

To deploy without the dashboard you will need to remove `org` and `app` fields from the `serverless.yml`, and you won’t have to run `sls login` before deploying.

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
